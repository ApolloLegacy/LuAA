    Name :          LuAA - advance.lua
                    Constructs dialog for advancing in script.
    Purpose :        
                    LuAA is a mobile visual novel application programmed in an open-source distribution of the extensible language, Lua, namely MicroLua. MicroLua is designed for ARM hardware architecture, specifically for an ARM7/ARM9 processor configuration found in the Nintendo DS. Thus, it disallows allocation of memory past 4MB, internally. It is packaged with the compiled (proprietary) ARM7/ARM9 binaries to prevent user manipulation. However, the front-end programmed in MicroLua is powerful enough for user customizability (re-compile all included files using NDSTool -> Pack to compile a .nds file). LuAA placed 1st in the Neoflash Spring Coding Competition 2009, originally named AceAttorneyDS (http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php?topic=5557.0), winning a $300 prize.
