LuAA is a mobile visual novel application programmed in an open-source distribution of the extensible language, Lua, namely MicroLua. MicroLua is designed for ARM hardware architecture, specifically for an ARM7/ARM9 processor configuration found in the Nintendo DS. Thus, it disallows allocation of memory past 4MB, internally. It is packaged with the compiled (proprietary) ARM7/ARM9 binaries to prevent user manipulation. However, the front-end programmed in MicroLua is powerful enough for user customizability (re-compile all included files using NDSTool). LuAA placed <a href="http://www.neoflash.com/forum/index.php/topic,5608.0.html">1st in the Neoflash Spring Coding Competition 2009</a>, originally named AceAttorneyDS, winning a $300 prize.

Background Information
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LuAA was developed for several reasons:

- To be the first ever Nintendo DS homebrew engine that works with an embedded file system.
- To aid the existing visual novel community with another platform they can migrate their work to (Nintendo DS).
- To test the extensibility and stability of the <a href="https://github.com/microlua">MicroLua</a> platform.

### Hardware Specifications

From Wikipedia:

**Memory capacity**: 4 MB RAM
**Top Screen**: A backlit, 3.12-inch, transmissive TFT color LCD with 256x192-pixel resolution and .24mm dot pitch, capable of displaying a total of 262,144 colors.
**Touch Screen**: Same specifications as top screen, but with a transparent analog touch screen.
**CPUs**: Two ARM processors, an ARM946E-S main CPU and ARM7TDMI coprocessor at clock speeds of 67 MHz and 33 MHz respectively.

An amazing diagram that illustrates the hardware architecture well is one of devkitPro's:

</p>

The most important parts to note are the screen sizes (256x192), the two CPUs (ARM7 and ARM9) and the RAM amount (4MB). Due to all of these factors, the graphics library for the Nintendo DS is somewhat limited.

1. Certain VRAM (video RAM) banks will operate on 15-bit RGB color. This implies that specified RGB values must be within (0 - 31), taking 2^5 bits of space each. The last bit is reserved to specify alpha levels on the memory bank.
2. The GBA (Gameboy Advance) cart is the "hack" used to accomplish my embedded file system implementation on external emulation. Basically, the Nintendo DS will act as if the embedded file system is actually extended RAM retrieved from the GBA slot, using resources found in the file system there. This is the sole reason why you must use the following command to run it on <a href="http://desmume.org/">DeSmuMe</a>:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ~ $ desmume gbaslot-rom=LuAA.nds LuAA.nds
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This essentially allocates the GBA slot to the NDS ROM, allowing the actual run binary to access resources from it.
3. Each screen has four background layers (BG0 ~ BG3). Each background layer, in 2D mode, has an 8-bit palette size limit and therefore can store tilemaps with up to 256 colours only.

### Software Specifications

The software architecture chosen for Lua is quite simple. If you open the `release/build` directory, you'll find the following files:

**arm7.bin**: The compiled binary for the 16-bit ARM7 processor found in the Nintendo DS. This handles 8 to 16 bit sound modules (think .mod, .xm, etc.) and some of the lesser functions required for operation.

**arm9.bin**: The compiled binary for the 32-bit ARM9 processor found in the Nintendo DS. This contains processing for just about everything else, including the GL, VRAM allocation and mathematical operations.

**banner.bin**: The palette and tilemap for the Nintendo DS ROM icon. Note that the palette length is 2 bytes and has a maximum colour amount of 16.

**header.bin**: The metadata required for the ROM to operate. Contains binary lengths, offsets, execution addresses, pointer tables and Nintendo publisher information.

**overarm7.bin/overarm9.bin**: The ARM7/ARM9 overlays help to map efficient routes to the compiled data files (images/sound/tilemaps) for speedy execution. However, since everything from LuAA is loaded from an embedded file system, these binaries are not used.

**data**: The external data used by the ROM that is not immediately loaded and cached by the ARM7/ARM9 processors. It should be of no surprise then, that this directory stores all the images, scripts and audio files required for LuAA to work.

`ndstool`, located in the `bin` directory, is used to compile these above into a standalone ROM that can be run on multiple emulators and on official hardware. Exciting, right?

Below is documentation on how to use the actual API.
